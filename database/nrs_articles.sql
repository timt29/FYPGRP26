On Sept 4, Law Jia Yi, 23, was handed five charges in relation to vapes. She was also charged over possessing a knife with a 20cm-long blade, a card knife and a screwdriver without lawful purposes in August 2024 at a carpark in Yishun. For Law’s vape-related charges, she allegedly had 55 Kpods and four vapes in Yishun Avenue 5 on Aug 9, 2024. That month, she also purportedly bought 50 Kpods in Geylang. It was not stated in court documents where or whom she bought them from. Separately, Law is accused of possessing 49 vape pods in Yishun, which were later analysed and found to contain etomidate. Law also allegedly had 98 vape pods and two vapes in Sentosa, in Siloso Road. She is also said to have had 91 Kpods at the same location. Law’s case has been scheduled for a pre-trial conference on Sept 11. On Sept 3, a 17-year-old boy was charged with possessing a vape device containing a cannabis-related substance. In his National Day Rally speech in August, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the Government will treat vaping as a drug issue and impose stiffer penalties. Since Sept 1, first-time etomidate abusers below 18 years old will be fined $500, while adults will be fined $700. This is a $200 increase for each group. They must also attend mandatory rehabilitation for up to six months. Sellers of Kpods will face higher penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Those who import Kpods will face between three and 20 years’ jail, and between five and 15 strokes of the cane. Those convicted of selling or distributing Kpods will face between two and 10 years’ jail, and receive between two and five strokes of the cane. The public can report vaping offences to the Tobacco Regulation Branch on 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 from 9am to 9pm daily, or online at go.gov.sg/reportvape Those using Kpods can seek help through a national programme called QuitVape. More information on vaping can be found at gov.sg/stopvaping, a microsite launched in August to consolidate resources, helplines and reporting avenues. The authorities have said that those who voluntarily seek support to quit vaping will not face any penalties for doing so.','Nadine Chua','2025-09-04 17:45:00','2025-09-05 00:16:00','../static/img/sel-kpod.jpeg',4,0,1),(2,'Jail for money mule who was promised $100 a day to withdraw cash for scammers','SINGAPORE – A financially strapped man withdrew scam proceeds in cash from ATMs to earn $100 a day so that he could buy diapers and milk powder for his newborn child. Yves Quah Jun Boon, 24, was sentenced to eight months’ jail on Sept 5 after he withdrew more than $150,000 from various ATMs in one day in June 2023. He pleaded guilty to money laundering and a charge under the Computer Misuse Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Jing Min said Quah often confided in his primary school friend, identified in court documents as Wei Jian, about his financial struggles – he needed money to pay for the needs of his newborn child. In June 2023, Wei Jian told Quah about an opportunity to earn $100 a day by withdrawing cash from ATMs. That month, Wei Jian and Quah met another man, named Ryan, to collect seven ATM cards registered under three different names, SIM cards and a mobile phone. Ryan told Quah that it was guaranteed to be a “safe job” and that the personal identification number, or PIN, for all the ATM cards was the same. Despite suspecting that he was asked to withdraw criminal proceeds, Quah went ahead with the job. On June 25, he withdrew $151,280 from ATMs at Woodlands Civic Centre and Ngee Ann City. When an ATM card prevented him from withdrawing money, he threw the card away. DPP Tan said Quah made at least 20 unauthorised withdrawals on that day. Quah then handed over the cash to a member of a money laundering syndicate, identified in court documents as Siyuan, at the Ngee Ann City carpark. Siyuan told Quah that $120 was missing and the amount would be deducted from Quah’s salary. This effectively meant that Quah would not be paid for what he did that day. Soon after this took place, the police arrived at the carpark, acting on a tip-off. Quah, Siyuan and Wei Jian were arrested and the $151,280 in cash was seized. The prosecutor asked for an eight-month jail term for Quah. She said: “The accused was not a traditional money mule... but he was part of the ecosystem that launders criminal proceeds, by withdrawing monies that had been deposited into money mules’ bank accounts.” Those convicted of money laundering can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $500,000, or both.','Nadine Chua','2025-09-05 14:05:00','2025-09-05 15:20:00','../static/img/scam.jpg',5,0,1),(3,'32 people caught for suspected Kpod abuse after new measures kicked in on Sept 1','SINGAPORE – The first week following sweeping changes to anti-vaping laws has seen the authorities apprehend 32 people across Singapore for suspected abuse of etomidate. In total, the authorities caught 232 people for vape-related offences between Sept 1 and Sept 7, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said late on Sept 8. Those caught with vapes have been issued fines, while devices suspected of containing etomidate have been sent for testing. Ongoing laboratory tests have so far confirmed 14 people to be in possession of Kpods. Seven results have returned negative, while the results for 11 others are still pending. The ministry said that three abusers have been served notices to attend rehabilitation for up to six months. “In line with the enhanced enforcement regime, etomidate abusers are required to attend rehabilitation in lieu of prosecution,” an MOH spokesperson said, adding that the rehabilitation programme will focus on education, counselling, and support to help individuals overcome their addiction. In a Facebook post, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who is also Coordinating Minister for Social Policies, said that the first alleged etomidate trafficker was charged on Sept 8 under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).','Andrew Wong','2025-09-08 22:07:00','2025-09-09 16:40:00','../static/img/kpods.png',6,0,1),(4,'Man arrested after fire at Chai Chee Avenue HDB block; 4 taken to hospital, 50 residents evacuated','SINGAPORE – A 58-year-old man was arrested for allegedly causing a fire to break out at an HDB block in Chai Chee Avenue on Sept 5, resulting in four people being taken to hospital and prompting the evacuation of about 50 residents. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to a fire at Block 31 Chai Chee Avenue at about 11.05pm. “The living room of an eighth-floor unit was on fire,” SCDF added. It said that it extinguished the fire with a water jet, and that there was no one inside the flat. In response to media queries on Sept 7, the police said the 58-year-old man was arrested for “causing or contributing to risk of dangerous fire”. They added that four men, aged between 20 and 78, were taken to hospital. They were all conscious. Three people from neighbouring flats were assessed for smoke inhalation. Two of them were taken to Changi General Hospital, and the third to Singapore General Hospital (SGH). A firefighter was also assessed for smoke inhalation and taken to SGH.','Grabrielle Andres and Vihanya Rakshika','2025-09-06 13:25:00','2025-09-07 22:44:00','../static/img/fire.jpeg',7,1,1),(5,'Singapore’s pharmaceutical sector faces uncertainty after new US 100% tariffs','SINGAPORE: The impact of the United States’ new pharmaceutical tariffs on Singapore remains uncertain, experts and companies told CNA.\r\n\r\nUS President Donald Trump announced on Thursday (Sep 25) that a new 100 per cent tariff on any “branded or patented” pharmaceutical products will take effect from Oct 1 - unless a company is building a manufacturing plant in the US.\r\n\r\nIndustry players in Singapore said that they are monitoring the situation, and at least one company told CNA that it is concerned about knock-on effects. \r\n\r\nMedical research organisation Hilleman Laboratories said it does not expect a direct impact on its Singapore operations, but flagged the possibility of ripple effects.\r\n\r\n“While we don’t expect immediate direct effects, the interconnected nature of global supply chains means we remain vigilant about possible knock-on impacts,” it said. \r\n\r\nThere is a risk that higher costs due to tariffs could affect affordability and access challenges, particularly for vulnerable populations, it added.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the challenges in navigating the changes to tariff policies, Hilleman Laboratories said: “The main challenge is uncertainty.\r\n\r\n“Shifts in trade policy can affect timelines, sourcing, and partnerships. Our role is to anticipate these changes while staying firmly on track with our scientific and public health commitments.”\r\n\r\nBiotechnology company BioNTech told CNA it was “monitoring the situation closely”, although it noted it has manufacturing sites in the US.\r\n\r\n“Together with our partner Pfizer we have manufacturing sites in the US and Europe for our COVID-19 vaccine,” BioNTech said. Pfizer is responsible for the commercialisation of BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine in the US.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical giant GSK told CNA it is \"engaging constructively\" with the US administration. \r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACT ON SINGAPORE\r\nUS tariffs on pharmaceutical imports threaten a key part of Singapore’s exports - pharmaceuticals make up about 13 per cent of the country’s exports to the US.\r\n\r\nLast year, Singapore was the fourth-biggest exporter of pharmaceutical goods to the US, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity. \r\n\r\nExperts said the impact of the tariffs on Singapore is still unclear, depending on the specifics of the policy, which have yet to be announced.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Wee Hwee Lin from the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the impact on Singapore’s pharmaceutical industry may be limited.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to assess at the moment, but I anticipate that there will be minimal effect as the manufacturing facilities in Singapore mostly produce active pharmaceutical ingredients and not the final product,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe added that she was “not surprised” by the US announcement as there had been “earlier signals” by Mr Trump.\r\n\r\nDr Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at philanthropic organisation Hinrich Foundation, warned that even within one company, different products may or may not be subject to the tariff. \r\n\r\n“I think it\'s a little unclear … because you\'ll need to look at not just which products are imported from abroad that are branded, not generics, but also (whether) those firms are producing products domestically,” she said. \r\n\r\n“Even if it\'s not the same product, it\'s a little unclear. So if I make product ‘A’ domestically, but not product ‘B’, can I just declare my full line of pharmaceuticals is therefore exempt from this tariff?”\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Elms also noted that even if companies started construction in the US to declare themselves exempt from the tariffs, it would not actually solve the problem.\r\n\r\n“At any point, Trump in the future could say, actually your facility isn\'t producing drugs yet, or it isn\'t producing enough drugs, and therefore … you are now required to pay these tariffs at 100 per cent, potentially more,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And so the uncertainty for the sector, and in fact, for all products being sent to the US continues.”\r\n\r\nFor Singapore, Dr Elms said the tariffs could be a problem as the country is increasingly looking to pharmaceutical manufacturing as a key export, and the US is an important market. \r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong on Saturday said the tariffs may not have an immediate impact on exports for pharmaceutical companies in Singapore, given that most already have plans to invest in the US.\r\n\r\nHe added that most of the country’s pharmaceutical exports to the US are primarily patented and branded products.\r\n\r\nBranded or patented pharmaceutical products refer to drugs sold under brand names that are protected by patents. When the patent expires, generic versions of the drug may then be sold by other companies. \r\n\r\nDr Elms noted that no tariffs had been implemented on generic products because of the thin margins of these drugs. \r\n\r\nA 100 per cent duty on generic drugs would be “unviable” and result in no sales to the US, putting many patients there at risk, she said.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries said it is closely monitoring developments.\r\n\r\n\"While details are still emerging, we remain committed to working with the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to help ensure continued access to innovative medicines and vaccines for patients in Singapore,\" it told CNA.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical firms in Singapore clarifying tariff exemption eligibility, many have plans to invest in US: DPM Gan\r\n\r\nTrump announces 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports from Oct 1\r\nWILL DRUG PRICES INCREASE?\r\nHow drug prices move will depend on changes, if any, to the US tax regime, said Assoc Prof Wee.\r\n\r\n“Pharmaceutical companies move their manufacturing facilities to countries such as Ireland because of the attractive corporate tax structure,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Prices may go up if they are forced to relocate the manufacturing facilities back to the US, unless there are changes to the corporate tax structure in the US.”\r\n\r\nDr Elms similarly noted that companies may need to isolate production of certain products in some locations due to quality requirements of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.\r\n\r\n“This potentially upends a lot of that and requires firms to make less than optimal decisions about where they\'re going to manufacture products,” she said.','Sam','2025-09-30 16:56:38','2025-09-30 16:56:38','/static/img/Singapores_pharmaceutical_sector_faces_uncertainty_after_new_US_100_tariffs_1759202854.png',1,0,1),(7,'Campus canteen goes fully cashless from October','A polytechnic canteen will pilot a fully cashless checkout lane, with QR and NFC terminals at every stall.
