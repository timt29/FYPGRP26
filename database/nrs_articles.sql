On Sept 4, Law Jia Yi, 23, was handed five charges in relation to vapes. She was also charged over possessing a knife with a 20cm-long blade, a card knife and a screwdriver without lawful purposes in August 2024 at a carpark in Yishun. For Law’s vape-related charges, she allegedly had 55 Kpods and four vapes in Yishun Avenue 5 on Aug 9, 2024. That month, she also purportedly bought 50 Kpods in Geylang. It was not stated in court documents where or whom she bought them from. Separately, Law is accused of possessing 49 vape pods in Yishun, which were later analysed and found to contain etomidate. Law also allegedly had 98 vape pods and two vapes in Sentosa, in Siloso Road. She is also said to have had 91 Kpods at the same location. Law’s case has been scheduled for a pre-trial conference on Sept 11. On Sept 3, a 17-year-old boy was charged with possessing a vape device containing a cannabis-related substance. In his National Day Rally speech in August, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said the Government will treat vaping as a drug issue and impose stiffer penalties. Since Sept 1, first-time etomidate abusers below 18 years old will be fined $500, while adults will be fined $700. This is a $200 increase for each group. They must also attend mandatory rehabilitation for up to six months. Sellers of Kpods will face higher penalties under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Those who import Kpods will face between three and 20 years’ jail, and between five and 15 strokes of the cane. Those convicted of selling or distributing Kpods will face between two and 10 years’ jail, and receive between two and five strokes of the cane. The public can report vaping offences to the Tobacco Regulation Branch on 6684-2036 or 6684-2037 from 9am to 9pm daily, or online at go.gov.sg/reportvape Those using Kpods can seek help through a national programme called QuitVape. More information on vaping can be found at gov.sg/stopvaping, a microsite launched in August to consolidate resources, helplines and reporting avenues. The authorities have said that those who voluntarily seek support to quit vaping will not face any penalties for doing so.','Nadine Chua','2025-09-04 17:45:00','2025-09-05 00:16:00','../static/img/sel-kpod.jpeg',4,0,1,0,2,2,'published'),(2,'Jail for money mule who was promised $100 a day to withdraw cash for scammers','SINGAPORE – A financially strapped man withdrew scam proceeds in cash from ATMs to earn $100 a day so that he could buy diapers and milk powder for his newborn child. Yves Quah Jun Boon, 24, was sentenced to eight months’ jail on Sept 5 after he withdrew more than $150,000 from various ATMs in one day in June 2023. He pleaded guilty to money laundering and a charge under the Computer Misuse Act. Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Jing Min said Quah often confided in his primary school friend, identified in court documents as Wei Jian, about his financial struggles – he needed money to pay for the needs of his newborn child. In June 2023, Wei Jian told Quah about an opportunity to earn $100 a day by withdrawing cash from ATMs. That month, Wei Jian and Quah met another man, named Ryan, to collect seven ATM cards registered under three different names, SIM cards and a mobile phone. Ryan told Quah that it was guaranteed to be a “safe job” and that the personal identification number, or PIN, for all the ATM cards was the same. Despite suspecting that he was asked to withdraw criminal proceeds, Quah went ahead with the job. On June 25, he withdrew $151,280 from ATMs at Woodlands Civic Centre and Ngee Ann City. When an ATM card prevented him from withdrawing money, he threw the card away. DPP Tan said Quah made at least 20 unauthorised withdrawals on that day. Quah then handed over the cash to a member of a money laundering syndicate, identified in court documents as Siyuan, at the Ngee Ann City carpark. Siyuan told Quah that $120 was missing and the amount would be deducted from Quah’s salary. This effectively meant that Quah would not be paid for what he did that day. Soon after this took place, the police arrived at the carpark, acting on a tip-off. Quah, Siyuan and Wei Jian were arrested and the $151,280 in cash was seized. The prosecutor asked for an eight-month jail term for Quah. She said: “The accused was not a traditional money mule... but he was part of the ecosystem that launders criminal proceeds, by withdrawing monies that had been deposited into money mules’ bank accounts.” Those convicted of money laundering can be jailed for up to 10 years, fined up to $500,000, or both.','random','2025-09-05 14:05:00','2025-09-05 15:20:00','../static/img/scam.jpg',5,0,1,0,3,5,'published'),(3,'32 people caught for suspected Kpod abuse after new measures kicked in on Sept 1','SINGAPORE – The first week following sweeping changes to anti-vaping laws has seen the authorities apprehend 32 people across Singapore for suspected abuse of etomidate. In total, the authorities caught 232 people for vape-related offences between Sept 1 and Sept 7, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said late on Sept 8. Those caught with vapes have been issued fines, while devices suspected of containing etomidate have been sent for testing. Ongoing laboratory tests have so far confirmed 14 people to be in possession of Kpods. Seven results have returned negative, while the results for 11 others are still pending. The ministry said that three abusers have been served notices to attend rehabilitation for up to six months. “In line with the enhanced enforcement regime, etomidate abusers are required to attend rehabilitation in lieu of prosecution,” an MOH spokesperson said, adding that the rehabilitation programme will focus on education, counselling, and support to help individuals overcome their addiction. In a Facebook post, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, who is also Coordinating Minister for Social Policies, said that the first alleged etomidate trafficker was charged on Sept 8 under the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).','Andrew Wong','2025-09-08 22:07:00','2025-09-09 16:40:00','../static/img/kpods.png',6,0,1,1,2,8,'published'),(4,'Man arrested after fire at Chai Chee Avenue HDB block; 4 taken to hospital, 50 residents evacuated','SINGAPORE – A 58-year-old man was arrested for allegedly causing a fire to break out at an HDB block in Chai Chee Avenue on Sept 5, resulting in four people being taken to hospital and prompting the evacuation of about 50 residents. The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to a fire at Block 31 Chai Chee Avenue at about 11.05pm. “The living room of an eighth-floor unit was on fire,” SCDF added. It said that it extinguished the fire with a water jet, and that there was no one inside the flat. In response to media queries on Sept 7, the police said the 58-year-old man was arrested for “causing or contributing to risk of dangerous fire”. They added that four men, aged between 20 and 78, were taken to hospital. They were all conscious. Three people from neighbouring flats were assessed for smoke inhalation. Two of them were taken to Changi General Hospital, and the third to Singapore General Hospital (SGH).

Our role is to anticipate these changes while staying firmly on track with our scientific and public health commitments.”\r\n\r\nBiotechnology company BioNTech told CNA it was “monitoring the situation closely”, although it noted it has manufacturing sites in the US.\r\n\r\n“Together with our partner Pfizer we have manufacturing sites in the US and Europe for our COVID-19 vaccine,” BioNTech said. Pfizer is responsible for the commercialisation of BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine in the US.\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical giant GSK told CNA it is \"engaging constructively\" with the US administration. \r\n\r\n\r\nIMPACT ON SINGAPORE\r\nUS tariffs on pharmaceutical imports threaten a key part of Singapore’s exports - pharmaceuticals make up about 13 per cent of the country’s exports to the US.\r\n\r\nLast year, Singapore was the fourth-biggest exporter of pharmaceutical goods to the US, according to data from the Observatory of Economic Complexity. \r\n\r\nExperts said the impact of the tariffs on Singapore is still unclear, depending on the specifics of the policy, which have yet to be announced.\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor Wee Hwee Lin from the National University of Singapore (NUS) said the impact on Singapore’s pharmaceutical industry may be limited.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to assess at the moment, but I anticipate that there will be minimal effect as the manufacturing facilities in Singapore mostly produce active pharmaceutical ingredients and not the final product,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe added that she was “not surprised” by the US announcement as there had been “earlier signals” by Mr Trump.\r\n\r\nDr Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at philanthropic organisation Hinrich Foundation, warned that even within one company, different products may or may not be subject to the tariff. \r\n\r\n“I think it\'s a little unclear … because you\'ll need to look at not just which products are imported from abroad that are branded, not generics, but also (whether) those firms are producing products domestically,” she said. \r\n\r\n“Even if it\'s not the same product, it\'s a little unclear. So if I make product ‘A’ domestically, but not product ‘B’, can I just declare my full line of pharmaceuticals is therefore exempt from this tariff?”\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Elms also noted that even if companies started construction in the US to declare themselves exempt from the tariffs, it would not actually solve the problem.\r\n\r\n“At any point, Trump in the future could say, actually your facility isn\'t producing drugs yet, or it isn\'t producing enough drugs, and therefore … you are now required to pay these tariffs at 100 per cent, potentially more,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And so the uncertainty for the sector, and in fact, for all products being sent to the US continues.”\r\n\r\nFor Singapore, Dr Elms said the tariffs could be a problem as the country is increasingly looking to pharmaceutical manufacturing as a key export, and the US is an important market. \r\n\r\n\r\nDeputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong on Saturday said the tariffs may not have an immediate impact on exports for pharmaceutical companies in Singapore, given that most already have plans to invest in the US.\r\n\r\nHe added that most of the country’s pharmaceutical exports to the US are primarily patented and branded products.\r\n\r\nBranded or patented pharmaceutical products refer to drugs sold under brand names that are protected by patents. When the patent expires, generic versions of the drug may then be sold by other companies. \r\n\r\nDr Elms noted that no tariffs had been implemented on generic products because of the thin margins of these drugs. \r\n\r\nA 100 per cent duty on generic drugs would be “unviable” and result in no sales to the US, putting many patients there at risk, she said.\r\n\r\nThe Singapore Association of Pharmaceutical Industries said it is closely monitoring developments.\r\n\r\n\"While details are still emerging, we remain committed to working with the Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to help ensure continued access to innovative medicines and vaccines for patients in Singapore,\" it told CNA.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n\r\nPharmaceutical firms in Singapore clarifying tariff exemption eligibility, many have plans to invest in US: DPM Gan\r\n\r\nTrump announces 100% tariff on branded or patented pharmaceutical imports from Oct 1\r\nWILL DRUG PRICES INCREASE?\r\nHow drug prices move will depend on changes, if any, to the US tax regime, said Assoc Prof Wee.\r\n\r\n“Pharmaceutical companies move their manufacturing facilities to countries such as Ireland because of the attractive corporate tax structure,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Prices may go up if they are forced to relocate the manufacturing facilities back to the US, unless there are changes to the corporate tax structure in the US.”\r\n\r\nDr Elms similarly noted that companies may need to isolate production of certain products in some locations due to quality requirements of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>“This potentially upends a lot of that and requires firms to make less than optimal decisions about where they\'re going to manufacture products,” she said.</strong></p>','Sam','2025-11-05 15:15:28','2025-11-05 15:15:28','/static/img/Singapores_pharmaceutical_sector_faces_uncertainty_after_new_US_100_tariffs_1759202854.png',1,0,1,19,1,0,'published'),(6,'‘A serious breach’: Goh Pei Ming on failures of two police officers in Megan Khung case','<p>SINGAPORE - The lapses by two police officers who did not follow operating procedure in Megan Khung’s case were a serious breach which resulted in tragedy.</p><p><br></p><p>Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Goh Pei Ming said this in Parliament on Nov 5, while noting that demands on police officers continue to increase.</p><p><br></p><p>Mr Goh said police officers often have to make difficult judgment calls every day and mistakes can happen under pressure.</p><p>He said: “In this case, the lapse arose because two officers, who were under pressure, did not follow the established operating procedure.”</p><p>Mr Goh’s statement was in response to questions filed by four MPs for the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on the police processes in Megan’s case.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(22, 22, 22);\">Four-year-old Megan died in February 2020 after&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/abusive-couple-burned-body-of-womans-daughter-after-man-fatally-punched-4-year-old?ref=inline-article&amp;ref=inline-article\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgba(51, 51, 0, 0.067);\">suffering a year of abuse</a><span style=\"color: rgb(22, 22, 22);\">&nbsp;at the hands of her mother, Foo Li Ping, and the woman’s boyfriend, Wong Shi Xiang.&nbsp;Her body was burned and never found.</span></p><p>The case involving the couple’s friend, Nouvelle Chua Ruoshi, 35, is pending.</p><p><br></p><p>A review panel’s report released on Oct 23 detailed lapses by various agencies, including the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)’s Child Protective Service and the police.</p><p><br></p><p>The police investigation officer (IO), who handled the first report relating to Megan’s case, and her supervisor failed to follow procedures to escalate the case for monitoring and guidance.</p><p><br></p><p>Both officers were investigated for neglect of duty.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/megan-khungs-death-one-cop-resigned-supervisor-handed-financial-penalty-over-handling-of-case?ref=inline-article\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgba(51, 51, 0, 0.067);\">The IO later resigned</a>, while her supervisor was given a financial penalty.In Parliament, Mr Gabriel Lam (Sembawang GRC) asked about MHA’s steps to review police IOs’ follow-up requirements for cases of missing vulnerable persons.

The charismatic political newcomer is also New York’s first Asian-American and first Muslim mayor.And with that, the governance of America’s largest city – home to 125 billionaires, the world’s largest stock exchange and major banks like JPMorgan Chase –&nbsp;passes into the hands of the self-described Democratic socialist with a loyal base in the far-left flank of the Democratic Party.</p><p><br></p><p>With an annual budget of US$120 billion (S$157 billion) and with 300,000 municipal workers at his disposal, Mr Mamdani will attempt to introduce a gamut of controversial ideas to make New York more affordable for working-class families, like freezing rents, free bus rides and free childcare for children under five.</p><p>Mr Mamdani beat Mr Andrew Cuomo, New York’s former Democratic governor, who ran as an independent and counted on support from the city’s moderate and Jewish voters. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa&nbsp;came in a distant third.&nbsp;</p><p>In a victory speech in front of cheering supporters, Mr Mamdani said: “New York will remain a city of immigrants, built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and as of tonight, led by an immigrant.”</p><p>He promised to get cracking on fulfilling his campaign promises and directly addressed US President Donald Trump, who had repeatedly called on New Yorkers to defeat him.</p><p>“Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I’ve got four words for you: Turn the volume up,” Mr Mamdani said.</p><p>The election saw the biggest turnout in a New York mayoral race in more than 50 years, with more than two million casting ballots, according to the city authorities. With roughly 90 per cent of the votes counted, Mr Mamdani had a 9 percentage point lead over Mr Cuomo.</p><p>It was also an election that put many ideas to the test.&nbsp;</p><p>Would a city that has the world’s highest concentration of Jews outside of Israel vote in a Muslim mayor who amassed a following for supporting Palestinian rights and refusing to make a clear call for the disarming of Hamas?&nbsp;It appears to have,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>although voter surveys before the election showed most Jewish voters said Mr Cuomo was their choice.</p><p>Would the city’s changing demographics, where Muslims now constitute 11 per cent of the population, play a role? That would be a good guess, although conclusions can be drawn only after polling data is fully analysed.</p><p>Would the voters split on age? Voters under 35 had shown unstinting support for Mr Mamdani in pre-election surveys, whereas the older generation preferred Mr Cuomo.</p><p>Would the race have ripples far beyond the city? This is likely to be true as well. Mr Trump cast himself personally into the mayor’s election, threatening to withhold federal funds if Mr Mamdani won.</p><p>And could Mr Mamdani’s<strong>&nbsp;</strong>win be seen as the first serious political challenge to Mr Trump?&nbsp;</p><p>Analysts are seeing the early emergence of a trend. Along with the mayoral contest in New York City, the Democrats also won the governors’ contests in Virginia and New Jersey, which were also held on Nov 4.</p><p>The trend underlines Mr Trump’s low approval ratings and raises fresh doubts about his ability to preserve the Republican majority in both Houses of Congress in 2026’s midterm elections.&nbsp;</p><p>The president’s party typically does lose seats in elections after the presidential election, said Dr John Fortier, an elections expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank.</p><p>“There’s clearly some movement in the Democratic direction, that’s not uncommon in such elections,” he said. “But I think the President’s numbers overall are also a little down, so there’s some movement against the President.”</p><p>The real lesson from the New York mayor’s race is for the Democrats, Dr Fortier added.</p><p>“Essentially, it was a race between two Democrats and a less prominent Republican. And the result reflects that within the Democratic Party, the energy is with the more educated, progressive wing. You will likely see people of that ilk looking to run in other races in 2026, and possibly a significant presidential candidate from that wing in 2028.”</p><p>Emerging from a polling station in Manhattan, Mrs Rebecca Weiss, a Jewish voter who said she was a lifelong Democrat, described it as the most difficult voting decision she had ever faced. She ruled out Mr Mamdani straight away because he was a&nbsp;“dangerous, anti-Semitic radical” and said she disliked the idea of voting for Mr Cuomo because he was a candidate supported by Mr Trump. “So I voted Republican for the first time in my life,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Mamdani has almost certainly received a far better response from the city’s South Asians, who make up about 5 per cent of the city’s population; he increased voter turnout among South Asians by about 40 per cent during the Democratic primary contest in June.&nbsp;</p><p>His colourful fliers in Bengali and Urdu were a new form of outreach appreciated by the community. The Chinese-Americans in areas such as Brooklyn and Queens also supported him in the primary contest.</p><p>A Nepalese-origin shopkeeper, Mr Gyanendra, who goes by only one name, said he had voted for Mr Trump in the 2024 election because he had found his candidacy “exciting”. He said he voted for Mr Mamdani because he was attracted to the idea of an Asian mayor of New York. “Let’s give him a chance,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Mushtaq Rahman, a Bangladeshi-American, said his whole family, including three school-aged children, would be at an election watch party for Mr Mamdani in Queens because they had contributed to his campaign and canvassed for him.</p><p>“He is from our community, he knows that life is tough for immigrants and he has the right opinion on Israel, which is a key issue for me. And he wants to make childcare cheaper. So he ticked all the boxes for me,” he said.</p><p>Ms Bethany Li, executive director of the Asian American Legal Defence and Education Fund, the oldest Asian-American civil rights organisation in New York, said: “Mamdani’s victory shows what’s possible when candidates take every community seriously.”</p><p>She added: “He met voters where they are – mosques, temples and synagogues, to taiji classes and senior centres – and listened to what mattered most to them. His campaign invested in culturally competent, multilingual outreach that made people feel seen and earned significant support from Asian communities.”</p><h2>The ‘smiling socialist’</h2><p>Born in Kampala, Uganda, Mr Mamdani moved to New York with his family at the age of seven and became a US citizen in 2018. His Indian-origin parents are Harvard alumni. His mother Mira Nair is a celebrated film director and his father, Professor Mahmood Mamdani, teaches at Columbia University.&nbsp;</p><p>He attended elite schools in New York and later earned a degree in Africana studies from Bowdoin College, where he co-founded the campus chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked as a foreclosure prevention housing counsellor in New York before he turned to political organising and eventually won three two-year terms as state assemblyman from Queens. His mayoral campaign reportedly received funds from philanthropist George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.</p><p>Along with his 28-year-old Syrian-American wife, an artist who was raised in Dallas, he lives in a rent-stabilised apartment in Astoria, Queens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Mamdani gave his critics plenty of fodder during his campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>His idea of taxing the rich caused shockwaves in a city which has the nation’s highest number of billionaires.

Clubs such as Malaysia’s Johor Darul Takzim, Thailand’s Buriram United and Singapore’s Lion City Sailors – who made the Asian Champions League Two final in 2025 – have shown their Asian counterparts that they mean business.</p><p>Football consultant Khairul Asyraf, who specialises in regional football, said the involvement of “notable figures” in the region’s football associations has not gone unnoticed by Fifa.</p><p>These figures include Football Association of Singapore president Forrest Li, the founder of home-grown tech firm Sea Limited, who reportedly has a net worth of US$9.9 billion (S$12.9 billion) and Regent of Johor Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, a hugely influential figure in Malaysian football who owns 11-time domestic champions JDT.</p><p>Other notables are Indonesian FA president Erick Thohir who is also the country’s Minister of Youth and Sports; and Madam Pang, the Thai FA president who hails from the Lamsam family, one of Thailand’s wealthiest with a net worth of US$890 million.</p><p>Khairul said: “This is happening on the back of the development of prominent names who are now involved in football in their respective countries. Currently, South-east Asia with a substantial population is being given a platform to showcase themselves and that is a sign that Fifa is taking South-east Asian football seriously.”</p><h2>Fifa tournament will be a boost for region</h2><p>Shortly after its announcement, Fifa added in a media statement that it would engage all stakeholders, including the Asian Football Confederation, the Asean Football Federation (AFF) and the Fifa member associations of the Asean member states, “with the precise format of the tournament to be finalised in due course”.</p><p>Fifa and AFF did not respond to ST’s queries for more details on the Fifa Asean Cup.</p><p>While there is no information on the dates or format of the tournament, the football fraternity believes that it will be a boon for the sport in the region.</p><p>At present, the Asean Championship does not fall during an official Fifa international window, which means clubs are not obliged to release their players. With the region’s top clubs involved in domestic leagues and cups, as well as the Asian Champions League and Asean Club Championship, some have decided that their players will sit out the Asean Championship.</p><p>During the 2024 edition, league competitions in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand continued and this resulted in weakened squads for the key contenders.</p><p>Furthermore, with more players now plying their trade in Europe and Japan, these clubs are even more unlikely to release players for the Asean tournament.</p><p>But a Fifa-sanctioned tournament could mean that clubs will be obliged to release the players, especially if it falls during a Fifa international window.</p><p>Calling Fifa’s endorsement a “huge deal” for South-east Asian football, Lions captain Hariss Harun said: “It can go a long way for football in this region.</p><p>“We never really had issues earlier on in the 2000s, but later on when more Asean players went on to play in Europe or in the bigger leagues, the tournament began to get deprived of the best players. Maybe a Fifa Asean Cup will allow the best of the best to be involved.”</p><p>Former Lion and current Geylang International head coach Noor Ali noted that the tournament’s association with Fifa will elevate its brand and recognition.</p><p>He added: “You get a lot more eyes on the event. And naturally with Fifa being involved, that means a lot more resources, better organisation, and it has an even more special feeling for fans and players.”</p><p>Agreeing with the sentiment, football commentator Dez Corkhill said: “The Fifa stamp does add additional credibility, although the Asean Championship has secured excellent sponsorship since its inception.”</p><p>But he added that “confusion remains”, owing to the scant details on the proposed format and significance of the Fifa Asean Cup.</p><p>One rumour that has generated considerable buzz is the Asean Cup being a possible pathway for direct qualification to the Asian Cup, a move that could significantly elevate the tournament’s importance and competitiveness.</p><h2>Following the footsteps of the Fifa Arab Cup</h2><p>In Fifa’s media statement on the Asean Cup, it said the tournament will bring together all Fifa member associations from the South-east Asia region “in a format that follows in the footsteps of the successful Fifa Arab Cup”.</p><p>Previously organised by the Union of Arab Football Associations, the Arab Cup was staged periodically from 1963 to 2012. Fifa took over its organisation and revived it in 2021 as the Fifa Arab Cup.</p><p>The inaugural edition had a prize purse of US$25.5 million and, according to Fifa, the 2021 edition allocated more than 600,000 tickets and had a global TV audience of 272 million.</p><p>For 2025, the prize money was raised to more than US$36.5 million and the champions of the Dec 1-8 tournament will get a staggering US$10 million.</p><p>In comparison, the 2024 Asean Championship handed out US$300,000 to the champions, US$100,000 to the runner-up, while the two semi-finalists each received US$50,000.</p><p>Khairul said: “If Fifa can ensure more money for the federations, which they have been able to do for all the national teams that have involved in all their other tournaments, it is better for the game here... money will trickle down back to the places where money should be spent for football, such as grassroots.”</p><h2>Can the two tournaments exist side by side?</h2><p>While the members of the fraternity whom ST spoke to agreed that the Fifa Asean Cup would be a boost, they were unanimous in their opinion that it should not be staged alongside the Asean Championship.</p><p>The next edition of the Asean Championship, which has been rebranded the Asean Hyundai Cup, is scheduled for 2026, although it is unclear if there will be clarity on Fifa’s plans by then.</p><p>Corkhill noted that Fifa had said that they “will engage all football stakeholders”, which could signal that the world body’s tournament would prevail.</p><p>Khairul added: “I doubt that the Asean Championship and the Fifa Asean Cup can exist side by side. The SEA Games football tournament is already an Under-22 event because of the fact that we already have an Asean Championship.</p><p>“So now, if a grander and bigger organiser, such as Fifa comes into play, I think there will only be one victor.”</p><p>Hariss stressed that the organisations need to be wary of the increasing number of matches that would be played.</p><p>He said: “In Singapore, most of the national team players come from Sailors or BG Tampines Rovers and both of these clubs already play many games.</p><p>“To have any more added will be very tricky.

Even then, the economy would lose billions in output.</p><p>About 600,000 federal employees are working without pay, 650,000 more are furloughed, and unemployment could rise by 0.4 of a percentage point if all furloughed employees are counted as temporary layoffs.</p><p>The shutdown hits the longest-ever milestone hours after Democrats landed a series of electoral wins in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races and in the New York City mayoral contest. President Donald Trump blamed the GOP losses – in part – on the ongoing impasse in Washington.</p><p>The shutdown has gone on so long that it is now about two weeks from outlasting the House-passed Bill that would have kept the government funded through Nov 21. That means even if lawmakers were to quickly negotiate an end to the shutdown – an outcome that still appears unlikely – Congress would imminently face a new funding lapse threat.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune said the Nov 21 date is “going to have to change” in any new Bill to reopen the government to ward off that possibility.</p><h2>Seasonal shutdown</h2><p>Government functions that most Americans can live without for a few days or weeks become more critical when they are down for a month and counting.</p><p>At the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the shutdown has darkened the agency’s FluView dashboard, which tracks weekly flu, Covid-19 and RSV data, and halted publication of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a mainstay for epidemiologists worldwide.

That will cover only about half of the normal monthly food stamp payments for 42 million Americans.</p><p>Agriculture officials warned that recalculating partial payments could take “anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months”. Two judges, in Rhode Island and Boston, ruled that suspending the programme outright likely violated federal law.</p><h2>Blame game</h2><p>Public opinion largely mirrors past showdowns: 45 per cent of voters blame Republicans for the shutdown and 33 per cent blame Democrats, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, a smaller gap than in 2019 but consistent with historical trends.</p><p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats are unified in demanding a full reopening of government.</p><p>“Our position as Democrats remains the same – and will continue to be our position,” he told reporters on Nov 3.</p><p>House Speaker Mike Johnson countered that Republicans have voted more than a dozen times to fund the government, while Democrats have blocked each attempt in the Senate.</p><p>“It’s the most extreme example of gaslighting in the history of American politics,” he said.</p><h2>Off ramps</h2><p>With both sides dug in, it could take an external pressure from voters or an extraordinary procedural manoeuvre to end the stalemate.</p><p>Mr Trump has renewed his call for Senate Republicans to use what is called the “nuclear option” –&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-calls-for-us-senate-to-scrap-filibuster-rule?ref=inline-article\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgba(51, 51, 0, 0.067);\">ending the century-old filibuster</a>– to pass a Bill.

When they talk, do the words spoken match the way their mouth moves? All these were taught to us to help spot deepfake content,” said Madam Lim, who attended the workshop held at the Lions Befrienders Active Ageing Centre in Ang Mo Kio.</p><p>“They taught us how to use tools such as ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Meta AI, but also warned us against sharing personal data with these apps, which is risky.”</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(22, 22, 22);\">Over at Fernvale Community Club in September, elderly couple Victor Lim and Jessie Teo were part of a 25-strong class learning about Gen AI from IMDA’s digital ambassadors.</span></p><p>“Previously with Google search, I had to click and read websites one by one. But with ChatGPT, it helps to compile information all in one place,” said Mr Lim, 75, who worked in the medical device sector before retiring in 2015.</p><p>However, he acknowledged that Gen AI apps and search engines alike are not immune to producing hallucinations and fake news.</p><p>“That’s why I tell Jessie to always have a second opinion, and don’t take information from just one source.&nbsp;Use multiple apps like Gemini and Microsoft Copilot, and see if there’s a difference in the responses.”</p><p>They are two of more than 6,000 seniors who have attended IMDA’s Gen AI workshops, which have been conducted since August 2024 and are regularly held at community centres and libraries.</p><p>With the new technology being used in everything from banking to daily interactions, it is important for seniors to learn a new “language” apart from the one they already know, said IMDA’s Mr Douglas Goh.</p><p>“This includes specifically addressing Gen AI’s drawbacks and limitations as part of the enhanced framework,” said Mr Goh, director of digital engagement and adoption at IMDA’s SG Digital Office.</p><p>“It balances both sides – teaching practical Gen AI applications for daily tasks like trip planning, while ensuring seniors understand the risks and how to manage them safely.”</p><p>To help make the learning process less challenging, IMDA conducts its workshops in various vernacular languages, and imparts information in a bite-sized manner.</p><p>“It’s a very warm setting, and it feels like we are all friends learning together,” said Madam Teo, 75. She began attending these classes in 2024 after being encouraged to do so by her husband, who has been attending digital adoption workshops since 2019.</p><p>ChatGPT even enabled Mr Lim to express his love for his wife better, by helping him create a poem for her birthday in September.</p><p>“If you told me to write this myself, it would have been too sappy,” said Mr Lim. “This helps to at least give the framework, and then I can edit it to what I want to say.</p><p>“This is also what Jessie does with cooking, to take inspiration from generated recipes and incorporate it into what she has already been doing.”</p><p>Though IMDA has conducted more than 500 Gen AI workshops, strong partnerships with organisations like DBS and the Singapore Computer Society (SCS) are needed for a digitally inclusive society, said Mr Goh.</p><p>Tapping the DSL framework, volunteers from SCS’ youth chapter have also conducted three Gen AI workshops for beneficiaries at the Braddell Heights Residents’ Network and New Hope Community Services so far.</p><p>The latter also includes low-income individuals and people with little to no family support, said the chapter’s executive committee vice-president Shafeek Ahamed. The aim is to run these lessons on a monthly basis so that participants can retain skills with consistent exposure.</p><p>“For many seniors, even simple digital tasks like setting reminders, taking notes during discussions or even drafting an e-mail can feel challenging,” he said.</p><p>“Gen AI can act as a powerful assistant, helping them manage these everyday tasks with greater ease and confidence.”</p><p>While many seniors might brush off the idea of learning about new technology, Mr Lim said it is important to keep the mind active and stay curious even after retirement. Armed with the skills he has picked up, he aims to create his own Gen AI workshop for his own group of friends.</p><p>“With my senior friends, some of them are afraid of being scammed when they learn how to use new tools.

The hiring push – announced days before the leaders’ meeting – shows China does not plan to back away from developing a framework for its best leverage against US tariffs.</p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(22, 22, 22);\">“It absolutely makes sense to me that they’re having to hire,” said associate director Cory Combs at consultancy Trivium China. “Even with the postponement of the Oct 9 controls, the whole apparatus remains on an expansionary trajectory.”</span></p><p>Mr Trump signed into effect on Nov 4 an extension of tariff relief on China, citing a commitment from Beijing to “postpone and effectively eliminate” the “current and proposed coercive global export controls on rare earth elements and other critical minerals”.</p><p>Still, the ceasefire could collapse if the US crosses China’s red lines on supporting self-ruled Taiwan, for example, or if Beijing’s magnet supply doesn’t meet Washington’s expectations. Under now-suspended measures, the Commerce Ministry would require permits for exports anywhere in the world containing even small amounts of rare earths, generating piles of paperwork.</p><p>After China imposed controls on seven rare earths in April, the export control bureau doubled its headcount to about 60, Reuters reported in June citing two people familiar with the matter. Those were likely civil servants loaned from lower-level government units on a temporary basis, a practice known as jiediao.&nbsp;</p><p>Chinese government agencies typically only recruit permanent staff once per year, after nationwide civil service examinations.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the five new commerce openings, the ministry is seeking one Japan and one South Korea expert to conduct research and diplomacy. Those nations are dependent on Chinese rare earths and have expressed alarm about Beijing’s attempts to throttle global supply.&nbsp;</p><p>During Mr Trump’s three-nation trip through Asia last week, Japan was among several countries that vowed to deepen cooperation with the US on critical minerals.&nbsp;</p><p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN in an interview this week that the US plans to go at “warp speed for the next one, two years” to break its reliance on China.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re going to get out from under the sword that the Chinese have over us,” he said. “This time, we have rallied the allies.”&nbsp;BLOOMBERG</p>','Tim','2025-11-05 17:15:08','2025-11-05 17:15:08','/static/img/Chinas_export_control_unit_begins_biggest_hiring_spree_since_2022_1762334108.jpg',5,0,1,0,8,4,'published'),(45,'Singapore, Australia upgrade ties; will deepen cooperation in defence and energy, among others','Singapore, Australia upgrade ties; will deepen cooperation in defence and energy, among others\r\n\r\nCANBERRA – Singapore and Australia will deepen their cooperation in many areas from defence to trade, as they further elevate bilateral ties.\r\nBoth sides on Oct 8 laid out what Prime Minister Lawrence Wong called a “very full and ambitious agenda” of 20 agreements under an upgraded Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), or CSP 2.0, as the countries marked 60 years of ties.\r\nThe CSP 2.0, inked in Australia’s capital Canberra on Oct 8, encompasses strengthening cooperation in defence, supply chain resilience, \r\ngreen and digital economies,food security, renewable energy and innovation, as well as emerging areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and space.\r\nThe upgraded partnership builds on the first CSP signed in 2015, and will comprise 80 initiatives, including 20 memorandums of understanding (MOUs) and agreements, as well as 11 new dialogues.\r\nThese dialogues cover five areas of bilateral cooperation, including peace and stability on the home front and in the region, further connecting the two economies, and the countries’ transitions to net-zero emissions targets.\r\nSpeaking to the press alongside Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at Parliament House in Canberra, PM Wong said the first CSP had delivered “real and tangible benefits for both countries”.\r\nThese included “pathfinding” pacts like the world’s first digital and green economy agreements, which were later emulated by other countries.\r\nBeyond benefiting both countries, he noted, this was an example of how multilateralism can be strengthened in the wider world.\r\n“So when we work together like that, we are not only looking at bilateral initiatives that benefit each one of us, but also looking with a view to preserve important multilateral frameworks or strengthen multilateral frameworks that will enable us to keep the rules-based global system going,” he said.\r\nThe work on this new agenda with CSP 2.0 has already started, added PM Wong, who, together with Mr Albanese, held the 10th Singapore-Australia Annual Leaders’ Meeting earlier in the day.\r\nFor instance, both sides have signed an MOU on economic resilience to ensure that critical goods continue to flow between the two countries during times of crisis or disruption.\r\nSingapore and Australia will work towards negotiating an arrangement on trade in essential supplies by the end of 2026 and explore options for a legally binding commitment in the future, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry in a separate statement. An Australia-Singapore economic resilience dialogue will also be established.\r\nAsked for further details, PM Wong said the countries are looking broadly at a range of essential supplies, such as food and medical supplies, building on experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic when there had been vaccine swops.\r\n“Many countries had imposed restrictions on exports, imports, and it was a very difficult time for both our countries; but because of the trust that we have between Australia and Singapore, we kept supply lines flowing between our two countries,” he said.\r\nThe two countries will also cooperate in new and emerging areas like cyber, digital, space and AI, as a means to shape international standards and harness the transformative potential of these new technologies, said PM Wong.\r\nDuring their meetings, PM Wong and Mr Albanese also exchanged views on regional and international developments, including the need to promote economic integration and strengthen multilateralism and Asean-Australia relations, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement.\r\nIn his remarks at the joint press conference, PM Wong noted that Singapore and Australia will have to “work together to shape the architecture for cooperation in the region”.\r\nAustralia has expressed its keenness to deepen trade and investment ties with South-east Asia through initiatives such as its Southeast Asia Economic Strategy to 2040 and its contribution of A$175 million (S$149 million) to Singapore’s Financing Asia’s Transition Partnership, and Singapore will continue to support such efforts, said PM Wong.\r\nThe countries will also cooperate under a new Third Country Training Programme to deliver capacity-building programmes for South-east Asian countries, including Timor-Leste, which will become Asean’s newest member in October.\r\nCommenting on Singapore and Australia’s mutual and aligned interests, Mr Albanese said: “One of the things that makes this relationship so solid is that we know where we’re coming from, and we know where we’re going together.”\r\nHe noted that both countries have a common world view on the importance of multilateralism, free and fair trade, as well as multilateral institutions such as Asean, which will soon convene in Kuala Lumpur, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which will soon meet in South Korea.\r\nHe also congratulated Singapore on\r\n the launch of the Future of Investment and Trade Partnershipin September,which brought together 14 countries in a bloc to boost trading links, but stopped short of saying Australia would participate in it.At the joint press conference, PM Wong was also asked about \r\ndeaths linked to an outage at Australian telco Optus,which is wholly owned by Singtel.\r\nHe offered his condolences and reiterated the Singapore Government’s stance that companies overseas are expected to act responsibly and comply with the laws of the country they are in.\r\n“I fully understand the anger, frustration and outrage at what has happened, because if this were to have happened in Singapore, I would feel the same,” he said, expressing hope that the investigation into the outage will be concluded soon, and that steps can be taken expeditiously to rectify the mistakes.\r\nPM Wong is on a six-day introductory visit to both Australia and New Zealand.\r\nHe will be in Auckland from Oct 9 to 11, where he will meet New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.\r\nThe two leaders are expected to announce an upgrading of bilateral ties from the existing Enhanced Partnership signed in 2019 to a CSP.','Sam','2025-11-05 17:20:42','2025-11-05 17:20:42','/static/img/image1_1762334442.png',5,0,1,4,1,2,'published');
